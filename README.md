**Tooltip Tweaks** enhances tooltips by adding new information for various items, while also improving many tooltips' layout and overall usability.

This mod uses **Mod Menu** and **YACL**, which allows you to configure different features. The default settings are pretty basic and are focused on pleasing most people, but you are free to explore and configure for yourself.
