**Tooltip Tweaks** enhances tooltips by adding new information for various items, while also improving many tooltips' layout and overall usability.

This mod uses **Mod Menu** and **YACL**, which allows you to configure different features. The default settings are pretty basic and are focused on pleasing most people, but you are free to explore and configure for yourself.

This mod requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl), and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).
